# Ketchum
It's like Tinder, but with Pokémon. Part of the Native App Studio course.

This assignment involves building a Tinder-like app with indivdual profiles and ListViews, to practice with multiple activities and lists. So why not go all the way and add in the infamous Tinder swiping too?
And it's no fun making a second Tinder, so why not some Pokémon to the mix to keep it interesting?

Ketchum is a Pokémon catching app where you can search for the coolest Pokémon in your area and catch them with your (right-swipes) Pokéballs. But be careful! The amount of Pokéballs you have is limited. Found a Pokémon you really have to have? Use the elusive Masterball! But choose wisely: you only get one!

You can also rate the pokemon, whether you want to swipe or not. Any rating you give a Pokémon will stay like that until you change it.
